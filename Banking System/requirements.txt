Banking Application Requirements Document
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for a web-based banking application. This application will allow users to create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and check their account balances.

1.2 Scope
The banking application will be developed as a web application accessible via standard web browsers. It will provide basic banking functionalities to individual users.

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
Banking Application: Refers to the web-based application being developed.
User: An individual who interacts with the application to manage their bank accounts.
Account Holder: The person who owns a bank account within the application.
2. Functional Requirements
2.1 User Management
User Registration

Users can create new accounts by providing their name and an initial deposit amount.
Upon registration, a unique account number will be assigned to each user.
Login and Authentication

Users must be able to securely log into their accounts using a username and password.
Authentication should be handled securely to protect user information.
2.2 Account Management
Account Operations

Users should be able to perform the following operations on their accounts:
Deposit money into their accounts.
Withdraw money from their accounts (with appropriate balance validation).
Check their account balance.
Account Identification

Each account should have a unique identifier (account number).
The application should ensure that account numbers are generated randomly and are unique across the system.
2.3 User Interface
User-Friendly Interface

The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface (UI).
UI elements should be responsive and accessible on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Feedback and Notifications

Users should receive clear feedback and notifications for actions such as successful transactions, errors, or account not found scenarios.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1 Performance
The application should be responsive and performant, ensuring quick loading times for pages and transaction processing.
Transactions should be processed within a reasonable timeframe to provide a seamless user experience.
3.2 Security
User data, especially passwords and account details, should be stored securely using encryption.
Secure authentication mechanisms should be implemented to protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
3.3 Compatibility
The application should be compatible with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
It should be responsive and functional across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
3.4 Scalability
The application architecture should support scalability to accommodate potential growth in user base and transaction volume.
Database and server configurations should be scalable to handle increased load without compromising performance.
4. Technical Requirements
4.1 Development Environment
The application should be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end.
Node.js with Express.js should be used for the back-end development.
Use of a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for data storage and retrieval.
4.2 Version Control
Version control should be implemented using Git, with a centralized repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
Proper branching and merging strategies should be followed to manage code changes effectively.
4.3 Testing
Unit testing should be conducted for both front-end and back-end components using frameworks like Jest (for JavaScript).
Integration testing should ensure the correct interaction between different system modules.
User acceptance testing (UAT) should involve stakeholders to validate system functionality against requirements.
5. Constraints
The application should comply with relevant banking regulations and data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
Development should adhere to the project timeline and budget constraints as defined by stakeholders.
6. Assumptions
Users have access to a stable internet connection to use the web application.
Basic knowledge of banking operations (deposit, withdrawal) is assumed for end users.
7. Dependencies
Integration with third-party services (e.g., payment gateways) for financial transactions.
Availability of development and testing environments with necessary hardware and software resources.
